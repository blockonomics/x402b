==Abstract==

This BIP defines a logical hierarchy for deterministic wallets based on an algorithm
described in BIP-0032 (BIP32 from now on) and purpose scheme described in
BIP-0043 (BIP43 from now on).

This BIP is a particular application of BIP43.

==Motivation==

The hierarchy proposed in this paper is quite comprehensive. It allows the handling of
multiple coins, multiple accounts, external and internal chains per account and
millions of addresses per chain.
