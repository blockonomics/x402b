==Abstract==

This BIP defines a protocol for any actor to perform ecommerce over HTTP using bitcoin payments

==Motivation==

[https://www.coinbase.com/en-sg/developer-platform/discover/launches/x402 x402 Protocol] was announced in May 2025. It allows APIs, apps, and AI agents to transact seamlessly, unlocking a faster, automated internet economy. It has been widely adopted in the crypto / ecommerce ecosystem validating the need of crypto powered internet payment protocol. However, bitcoin support has been missing

Given some historical context, support of HTTP status code 402 has been discussion in bitcoin since 2011 [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3895.0 [1]] [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/27g1z0/402_payment_required_this_code_is_reserved_for/ [2]]. The community though hasn't formally published a protocol thus impeding its usage.

==Challenges==
Implementing x402 in bitcoin has various challenges, which we delve into: 

# Address Generation: In bitcoin wallets, unique address is generated for each order. This doesn't scale in case of agentic payments as in a hour there could be thousands of order requests that cannot be rate limited with human captcha. Adddress generation without actual payments can only continue till BIP44 gap limit (default 20). High gap limit values result in slowing down funds discovery of the BIP44 wallet. Single address for all orders isn't bad for privacy and it is difficult to track which order was paid without a wallet connect mechanism
# Single Address: x402 uses a single address 
# Asynchronous F
